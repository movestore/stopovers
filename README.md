## Description
Segmentation alogrithm that efficiently extracts segments of each individual track that fulfill the criterion to stay within a disk of given radius for a minimum duration of time. This algorithm was often used to extract stopover sites of migrating animals.

## Documentation
The App is based on a segementation algorithm that has been developed and published in collaboration with Maike Buchin and Stef Sijben from the Univeristy of Bochum. (https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-32316-4_2).

The algorithm passes through each individual movement track and calculates segments that fullfil the criteria to lie in a given maximum radius for a given minimum time duration. The calculations are based on great-circle distances of lat/long locations and relate each location to a potential smallest disk midpoint. The smallest disk calculations are implemented acoding to an algorithm described in Section 4.7 of De Berg, Cheong, Van Kreveld, Overmars: Computational Geometry, Algorithms and Applications, 3rd ed. Springer, 2008. The several computational optimisation steps make this App highly efficient.

### Input data
moveStack in Movebank format

### Output data
moveStack in Movebank format

### Artefacts
`stopover_sites.csv`: .csv-file with Table of all individuals' stopover sites and their properties (arrival, departure, mid location, stopover duration and radius)

### Settings 
**Minimum stopover duration (`duration`):** Defined minimum duration that the animal has to stay in a given radius for it to be considered a stopover site. Unit: `seconds`.

**Maximum stopover radius (`radius`):** Defined maximum radius the animal has to stay in for a given duration of time for it to be considered stopover site. Unit: `metres`.

### Null or error handling:
**Setting `duration`:** If no duration AND no radius are given, the input data set is returned with a warning. If no duraiton is given (NULL), but a radius is defined then a default duration of 86400 seconds = 24 hours = 1 day is set. 

**Setting `radius`:** If no radius AND no duration are given, the input data set is returned with a warning. If no radius is given (NULL), but a duration is defined then a default radius of 10000 m = 10 km is set. 

**Data:** If there are no resting locations retained after all analyses, NULL is returned, likely leading to an error.
